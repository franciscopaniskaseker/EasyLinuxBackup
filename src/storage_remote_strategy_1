# Usually you need to recicle your backups to save space (money!) and save as many backups as possible.
# The first strategy will be storage at least 30 days of backups without save a lot of files.
# We will try to save space and try to reduce catastrophe impact.. so first strategy is:
# (1) save every 00hs backup of first and fifth day of the month (2 backups)
# (2) save every 00hs backup of week day, sunday to sunday (7 backups)
# (3) save every hour backup of day, 1:00AM until 23:00PM (23 backups)
# 
# We will save backups in these directories:
# (1) monthly_1 and monthly_15
# (2) weekly_sunday, weekly_monday, ... and weekly_saturday
# (3) hourly_1, hourly_2, ... and hourly_23
#
#
# requirements:
# - correct date (ntp server highly recommended)
# - egrep installed
#
# parameters: n/a
# return: path name
