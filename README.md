# EasyLinuxBackup
Easy way to backup Linux things

I want to provide an easy way to backup all Linux files and services. Most of backup tools want to offer all features that is possible with a lot of restrictions and a lot of pages of documentations trying to explain what you need to do, in general way, asking you to think a lot, try and try and try to get things work. I do not want that. I want that you only need call methods providing certain parameters and get backup working.

# How you will do that?
Probably you will think "Are you out of your mind???", but my idea is provide a RULE called #idrule followed of parameters to that rule proceed backup. And my script will be only one file, like jquery.js or something like that. And the rules will never change... if I need upgrade something... I will create a new rule! The rules will never change!

So yes, if you need a new strategy or mode of backup, I have to write this for you. Or you send a commit adding that rule using my library. This script will have a lot of rules and that rules will do what they have to do without any possibility to customize that rule. I want to you have simple way to do your backups without think. You only have to be concerned to provide correct parameters...

# What language and tools you will use?

Bash script and only opensource software (that all repositories have). Seriously, I do not want to make your (and my) job more stress.
